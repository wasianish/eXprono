eXprono

The Basics
=======
eXprono is a two piece interface between a computer and an Arduino.

The GUI:
- The gui is designed for intuitive interaction with the arduino.  You can choose which arduino you are using and which COM port the board is attached to.

The jSSC library is included for ease of use.  We do not own the code in jSSC.

This idea was developed at the Kent State "Kent Hack Enough" Hackathon by Anno van den Akker, David Lance, Morgan McMahon, Ross O'Hagen.
We are all students at Case Western Reserve University students with expected graduation in May of 2018.
