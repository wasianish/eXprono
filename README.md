eXprono

The Basics
=======
eXprono is an interface between compuer and Arduino.

The jSSC library is included for ease of use.  We do not own the code in jSSC.

This idea was developed at the Kent State "Kent Hack Enough" Hackathon by Anno van den Akker, David Lance, Morgan McMahon, Ross O'Hagen.
We are all students at Case Western Reserve University students with expected graduation in May of 2018.
